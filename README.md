Description: In this video, it is a robot hand that can trace the movement of the user's hand when the user wears the gloves. 
The circuit is connected behind the glove in order to track the wispy movements of each joint of the finger.

-Device: 
A device can detect object’s height and weight

-Overall Concept:
In this device, I am going to create a device which can detect the height and the weight of small object. 

-Sketch :

-Description: 
For the height part, there will be a Distance Ranging Sensor to display the height of this object. If the object higher than a specific number, there would be a led turn to a red light. Otherwise, when the object comes close to the sensor, the light would be green. For the weight part, a Square Force-Sensitive Resistor can help detect the object’s weight approximately. When the object put on the Square Force-Sensitive Resistor, the force will be detect. If the force larger than the weight number set in advance, another led would turn to red. Otherwise, this led would be green when the object put on the force sensor. 

-Punch List:
Step 1: 


break the full project into smaller, more manageable pieces
identify which pieces are necessary for a minimum viable product (i.e. essential)
identify which pieces are "nice to have" (i.e. non-essential)
